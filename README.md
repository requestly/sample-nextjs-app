# Sample Next.Js App

We have a simple To Do App which is based on Next.Js for frontend and Node.js for the backend server.

There are errors made into the app because of which we are not able to create or delete any task in production environment.

So we will debug the issue through <a href="https://requestly.io">Requestly</a> and try to debug the issue without setting up the backend in our local machine, we will use capabilities of production backend server, as we know there are no issues there.

Know about the debugging process in detail <a href="https://requestly.io/blog/2021/12/28/debugging-next-js-app-in-production/">here</a>
